# Project 5: Customer Feedback Analysis for an Online Store

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer feedback for an e-commerce business. The main goal is to understand customer sentiment, identify common complaints and suggestions, and provide actionable insights to improve product quality and customer satisfaction.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer feedback data to understand sentiment and trends.
- Use natural language processing (NLP) to classify feedback as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Identify common topics and key issues mentioned by customers.
- Provide recommendations based on customer feedback insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is simulated to represent customer feedback for an online store. It includes features such as customer ratings, text-based comments, and feedback timestamps.

## Methods
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing feedback data for analysis, including handling missing values and text normalization.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Using NLP techniques to classify feedback as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Topic Modeling:** Identifying common topics in customer feedback using techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- **Visualization:** Generating visual representations of sentiment distribution and key topics discussed by customers.

## Results
The analysis revealed several key insights about customer sentiment and feedback:
- **Positive Feedback:** Customers frequently praised product quality and customer service responsiveness.
- **Negative Feedback:** Common complaints included delivery delays, product defects, and customer service issues.
- **Suggestions:** Customers suggested improvements in delivery speed and product packaging.

## Key Insights
- Positive sentiment is mainly driven by product quality and quick response from customer service.
- Negative sentiment is primarily related to logistical issues, such as delivery delays.
- Topic modeling helped identify areas for improvement, including better packaging and faster shipping.

## Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations to help understand customer sentiment and feedback trends:
- **Word Cloud:** Highlights common words in customer feedback.
- **Sentiment Distribution:** Shows the proportion of positive, negative, and neutral feedback.
- **Topic Distribution:** Displays the most frequent topics mentioned in feedback.
